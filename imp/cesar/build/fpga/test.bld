Checking expanded design ...
ERROR:NgdBuild:604 - logical block 'fpga_inst' with type 'tlv_gp_ifc' could not
   be resolved. A pin name misspelling can cause this, a missing edif or ngc
   file, case mismatch between the block name and the edif or ngc file name, or
   the misspelling of a type name. Symbol 'tlv_gp_ifc' is not supported in
   target 'spartan3'.
