The CA model of vole population
===============================

CA
--

- size = 60x60 cells == 1 Ha

cell
----

- size = 2,7778 m^2 (= 10000m^2/3600)

radius of neigbourhood
----------------------

- the distance in which is still possible for the voles to multiplicate

- hrabos-info(13) => cca 850, sqrt(850) = 29, 29/sqrt(2,7777) = 16 cell
								---------radius

natality
--------

- 3 - 4 calf each seasson => 270/3.5 = 77, 77/25 = 3 => each 3 time steps one
  calf

mortality
---------
- overpopulation => 95% 

- male fight => 40%

- normal ... - unknown


Time Step
---------

- cca 25 days == the time newly born voles needs to become adults
              == the time of vole being with calf 

TODO
----
	- add time cnt to CA for stats and for deterimiting the seassons
	  for the natality and volecalipse()
